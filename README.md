# Pandas-challenge
### Data Analysis of sample district-wide standarized test results for math and reading scores (9th-12th grade).

This script takes advantage of Jupyter Notebook features to showcase the description of the workflow (Markdown), the programming code (Python), computing and displaying results (Pandas Dataframes).

The analysis is done through the following workflow:
1. Read data from imput files (CSV).
2. Import CSV data into DataFrames.
3. Build analysis dataset:
   + Combine (merge) data into a single dataset.
   + Select relevant data (columns) and rename headers to generate a clear and concise analysis dataset.
   + Add data validators (score pass booleans) to compute results in a consistent manner across the whole data analysis.
4. Compute and Summarize data:
   + Descriptive statistics (sum, avg, %).
   + Sorting.
   + Conditional statements to filter data.
   + Combining (merging).
   + Binning.
5. Display results:
   + Dataset (tables) visualization.
   + Styling (display results in a clean format).
   + Description of observable trends based on data
